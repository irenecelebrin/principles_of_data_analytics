# Principles of Data Analytics 

Assignments and tasks for Principles of Data Analytics 

## About this repository

### The project 

This project was started in February 2025 as as part of the course *Principles of Data Analytics*. 
It includes sourcing and manipulating the Iris dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning reporsitory](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris). 

The dataset is explored and manipulated to extract meaningful data and represent them grafically through plots and charts. 


### Packages and Libraries  

**Getting started**

Pyhton: This projects was developed using Python 3.12 inside Jupyter Notebooks. 

**Modules** 

It requires the following modules and packages. If accessing this project locally, the modules need to be installed, if they are not marked as 'built-in'. 
 - [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to source the dataset 
 - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) to make calculations on the data
 - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to represent the data graphically

## Tasks 

All the tasks are included in the Notebook [tasks.ipynb](/workspaces/principles_of_data_analytics/tasks.ipynb) in this repository. 

### Task 1: source the data set 
### Task 2: explore the data structure
### Task 3: summarize the data 


#### Extra: Some shortcuts to run the notebooks on Jupyter notebooks 

**Some shortcuts**
- render markdown cell: shift + enter | run code cell: shift + enter 
- delete a cell : D D 
- enter in edit mode: Enter 
- go in escape mode: Esc 
- add a cell above: A, add a cell below: B -- a code cell
- turn code cell in md cell: M
- turn md cell in code cell: Y
- fn + F1 to add shortcuts
