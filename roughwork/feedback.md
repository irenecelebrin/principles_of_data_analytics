## Presentation

- Your repository seems reasonably well-organized. Continue following standard repository conventions.
- Your files and folders seem to be in lowercase, as is appropriate, with the usual exceptions for files like README.md. This helps to avoid issues with case-sensitive file systems.
- You have used appropriate characters in your file and folder names, avoiding spaces and other annoyances. This is good practice, avoiding issues on the command line.
- **The correct notebook(s) may not be included in your repository. Please double-check the assessment instructions to ensure all required files are present and correctly named.** DONE
- Remember there should be no unnecessary files in the repository, with the exception of anything in a folder called roughwork in the root of your repository. See the assessment FAQ for more details.
- I have included feedback on any notebooks that are included under a different name below. However, please ensure they are renamed appropriately or removed if not forming part of your submission.

## Research
- **Your README.md does not currently include any URLs. Make sure to include explanations of and links to any tools, packages, or documentation required to view, understand, and run your code. Each reference should be placed where it is relevant, with a brief description explaining why it is relevant.** 
- Your notebooks contain URLs linking to references in them. Make sure you keep including references to any resources you used in your work. Each reference should be placed where it is relevant, with a brief description explaining why it is relevant to your work.
- **Your notebooks should include more Markdown cells to provide context for your work. Remember to intersperse Markdown cells with code cells to explain your work.**  DONE 

## Documentation
- **Make sure you follow GitHubâ€™s advice on READMEs for writing a README.md.** DONE
- **The correct notebook(s) may not be included in your repository. Please double-check the assessment instructions to ensure all required files are present and correctly named.** DONE
- **Notebooks need to include informative comments that clarify the purpose and functionality of your code. It would be a good idea to enhance your work with more comments in code cells.** DONE
- **I suggest including more Markdown cells in your notebooks. Remember to intersperse Markdown cells with code cells to explain your work.** DOBE
- **Your notebooks should include informative titles. In particular, make sure your notebook has a level 1 Markdown heading at the top. Include appropriate titles for each section of your work.** DONE

## Development
- **Make sure to include enough instructions so a knowledgeable user can set up an environment and install the necessary dependencies to view your work and run your code. It would be good to include a requirements.txt file in your repository, for starters.** DOBE
- Your .gitignore file seems appropriate. Make sure you keep it up to date with any files or folders you do not want committed to your repository.
- I could successfully run the notebooks in your repository without error. Make sure you keep them up to date and running smoothly.
- Your notebooks contain executed cells in the correct order. Make sure you keep restarting the Python kernel and running all cells in order before committing your work.
- **One or more of your notebooks contains import statements that are not in the first code cell. Make sure you move all import statements to the first code cell of your notebook.** DONE
